# Automated Test for Finding Junior Quality Assurance Positions

## Overview

This project contains an automated test designed to search for "Junior Quality Assurance" positions on a job search website. The test automates the process of navigating to the website, entering the desired job title, and checking the search results. This project was created to showcase my skills in automation testing and my interest in Junior Quality Assurance roles.

## Test Scenario

The automated test simulates the following steps:

1. Navigates to the website's careers page.
2. Enters "Junior Quality Assurance" into the search bar.
3. Validates that the search results accurately reflect the available positions.

## How to Run the Test

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Execute the `JuniorQAPositionTest` class.

## Expected Result

The test is designed to verify that the search results accurately display the available "Junior Quality Assurance" positions.

## Additional Notes

* The test uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
* The test data (job titles) is parameterized to allow for easy modification and expansion.
